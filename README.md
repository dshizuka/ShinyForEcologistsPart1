# Break this app: an ecologist's intro to Shiny

Hello and welcome to my first tutorial on the R Shiny framework! Shiny is a framework for building interactive webpages using the R programming language. That means you can build powerful, customizable online tools to engage stakeholders in research communication using R programming skills you might already have. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to build a Shiny app that displays trends in Stellar sealion pup count data at different locations over time. This tutorial is meant to be an absolutely basic intro to Shiny, so if you're already making Shiny apps it might be a bit too basic for you. If you're looking for some help building your first app, this is the place for you! 

## What do I need to make a Shiny app?

To get started, you'll need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer. The main prerequisite to building our sealion Shiny app is a basic understanding of the Tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed for data science. If you're new to the Tidyverse, I highly recommend the book R for Data Science, as well as the unofficial solutions manual. 

Ready to get started? Awesome! Let's open RStudio and make sure our required packages are installed:  

```r

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("shiny")
```
