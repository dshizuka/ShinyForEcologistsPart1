# Break this app: an ecologist's intro to Shiny

Hello and welcome to my first tutorial on the R Shiny framework! Shiny is a framework for building interactive webpages using the R programming language. That means you can build powerful, customizable online tools to engage stakeholders in research communication using R programming skills you might already have. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to build a Shiny app that displays trends in Stellar sealion pup count data at different sites over time. 

## What do I need to make a Shiny app?

To get started, you'll need to have RStudio and R installed on your computer. While the code in this tutorial isn't super complex, having a solid basic grasp of R will be important. The main prerequisite to building our sealion Shiny app is a basic understanding of the Tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed for data science. If you're new to the Tidyverse, I highly recommend the book R for Data Science, as well as the unofficial solutions manual. Ready to get started? Awesome! Let's open RStudio and make sure our required packages are installed:  

```r

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("shiny")
```
